## Notes

I didn't have any problem with the video tutorial, and I learned a lot from it. However, since I'm a visual learner (and completely new to computer programming) after the initial video, I struggled with just trying to figure out how to do the things that I wanted to implement (and there were a lot of things that I wanted to do with the app). For example, I wanted the segmented control section to actually be images (smiley faces) instead of words, but I couldn't figure out how to change this with the just the manual/written explanations. Another issue I had was just worrying about deleting all of my work. Therefore, I was nervous about making changes that I feel that I could have figured out (for example, connecting the settings changes to change the values for the tips) however, I feared that I would end up deleting something and having to start all over. This has happened to me several times, and for some reason, when I try to undo an error, the option is not there. So I end up removing something important or changing the function of something else. Therefore, I kept my calculator as minimal as possible to make sure the primary functioning was there. With more time, and maybe more video tutorials, I could create a better application.
